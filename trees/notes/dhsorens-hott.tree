\p{
    Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) is a type theory whose types can be interpreted (usefully) as topological spaces, complete with loop spaces, homology, and homotopy groups. % I got into it as I was moving into computer science from a pure-mathematical [background](dhsorens-0005) focused mostly on algebraic topology.
    [The HoTT book](http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/) is the best introduction that I know of. Also Egbert Rijke's [Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11082).

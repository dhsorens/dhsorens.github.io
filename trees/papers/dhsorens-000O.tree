    \em{Paper Abstract:} Tokenized carbon credits are of growing relevance to voluntary carbon markets, but because tokenized carbon credits are typically NFTs, they suffer from low liquidity and high price volatility on-chain. Current solutions pool carbon credits to enable greater liquidity, but are incomplete. We present a novel pooling mechanism which we call a structured pool, which addresses issues with current pooling techniques.

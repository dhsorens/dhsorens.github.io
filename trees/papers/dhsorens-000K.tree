    \em{Paper Abstract:} Smart contract upgrades are costly from a verification perspective and can be a meaningful source of vulnerabilities when done incorrectly. Unfortunately, there is no established, formal framework through which one can reason about contracts as they undergo upgrades, though much work has been done to verify standalone smart contracts. Instead, one must repeat the full verification process for each contract upgrade, something which relies heavily on fallible intuition, can lead to unexpected vulnerabilities, and drives up the cost of formally verifying smart contracts. We propose a formal framework for contract upgrades in ConCert, a Coq-based smart contract verification tool. Central to this framework is our notion of a contract morphism, a theoretical tool which we introduce to formally encode structural relationships between smart contracts, and with which we can formally specify and verify an upgraded contract relative to its previous versions. We argue that ours is a natural framework for specifying and verifying contract upgrades, and hope to offer a first step towards rigorous, efficient specification and verification of contract upgrades.

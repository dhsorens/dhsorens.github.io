# Website (Forester)

This is the code for updating my personal website. To update, compile and upload the contents of `output/` onto a web server.

To compile and view (locally)

```bash
    view.sh
```

To make a new note:
```bash
    new.sh
```
this will automatically generate a new tree (?) and index it properly; you can transclude trees into each other from there.

Some commands [are here](cmds.md). 

Also the [10 min introduction on forester](https://www.forester-notes.org/0052/index.xml) and [some 2023 release notes](https://www.forester-notes.org/005P/index.xml).
